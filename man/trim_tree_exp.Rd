\title{Collapse branches with high expected mis-assignments.}
\usage{
trim_tree_exp(tree, tol)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A binary \code{phylo} object with internal node confidence scores in
\code{tree$node.label}.}

\item{tol}{Numeric tolerance expressed as a fraction of total tips; the
threshold is \code{length(tree$tip.label) * tol} expected errors.}
}
\value{
A renumbered \code{phylo} object with overly uncertain branches collapsed.
}
\description{
Computes the expected number of incorrectly assigned tips for each internal
branch (based on (1 - p) * clade size, where p is the branch
confidence) and collapses branches whose expectation exceeds a tolerance
derived from the total number of tips.
}
