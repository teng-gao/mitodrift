\title{Moving-average smoothing across matrix rows}
\usage{
row_smooth(M, k, na_rm = FALSE, edge = c("partial", "full"))
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{Numeric matrix to smooth (rows are independent series).}

\item{k}{Integer window width (must be >= 1).}

\item{na_rm}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, compute means ignoring \code{NA}s, otherwise only
windows containing no \code{NA} values contribute.}

\item{edge}{Either \code{"partial"} or \code{"full"}; governs boundary handling as
described above.}
}
\value{
Matrix of the same dimensions as \code{M} containing smoothed values.
}
\description{
Applies a fixed-width moving average independently to every row of a matrix.
Missing values can be optionally ignored, and the \code{edge} argument controls how
windows at the matrix boundaries are handled. With \code{edge = "partial"}
(default), windows that extend past the matrix edge shrink to the available
cells, while \code{edge = "full"} enforces the full window size by returning
\code{NA} when a complete window cannot be formed.
